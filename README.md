# oohgamejam2020

In the year 2020, the Games Den at the University of Alberta decided to host a game jam. https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/thegamesden/home

The Out of Hibernation Game Jam (OohGameJam), with the theme of "Comfort".

For our game, we decided to focus on eating, companionship and slow-paced things.

So we made a game about feeding your fishy friends and selling them.
